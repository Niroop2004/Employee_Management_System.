# Employee_Management_System.
This Employee Management System employs Python with Tkinter for frontend and MySQL for backend, enabling basic CRUD operations. It offers a user-friendly interface for managing employee records efficiently.

Hi ! everyone welcome to my project :)
Steps to use my project
Step 1 : You must install tkinter library from the terminal of your editor to run the login page.

step 2 : Change the login Credentials accordingly before running the code.

step 3 : You must make sure that you have installed MySql in your laptop, after installing MySql you have created on password while getting into it. The same password, host and user name must be given in the database.py before running the code.

step 4 : After changing the host, user and password of MySql you can run the code without any error.

step 5 : If you want run the after a very long time the code will give error after the login page in your editor this is because the database must be on before running the code. So for that go the MySql command line Client in your desktop, enter the password, your MySql server is on. Now rerun the login page you will be taken to the Employee_management_system interface after clicking OK on the login box.

**STEP 3 and STEP 4 are most important if you dont give the correct host,user and password the code will throw an error.**

Here are the few Screenshots of my project.
